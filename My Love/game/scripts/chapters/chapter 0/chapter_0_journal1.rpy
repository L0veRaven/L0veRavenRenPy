    alexJournal "Journaling still feels very strange to me. It's like I'm talking to the void... but there's nothing else I can do right now. I'm at work, so I can't really call anyone, not that there's anyone for me to talk to.\n"

    alexJournal "There's a new person that moved into the vacant apartment next to me. Her name is Claudia and there's something that sticks out about her. I haven't been able to stop thinking about her, but that's not normal for me. At all.\n"

    alexJournal "I don't really talk to people much except for Tsukune and Ash, but they're coworkers. Does that even count?"

    alexJournal "Maybe it's because Claudia is new, but I really want to keep talking to her. She's really pretty and seems nice...\n"

    alexJournal "Wait... is this what having a crush feels like?"
