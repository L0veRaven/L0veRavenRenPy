    alex "Hey Tsukune, I'm good! Nothing crazy's going on."

    tsukune "My car is still in the shop right now. It sucks! They said it'll be done by Wednesday though."

    alex "What's the car in the shop for again?"

    tsukune "The AC compressor seized up and completely snapped the serpentine belt. You should've seen the smoke come out of the air vents when that happened!"

    alex "What's taking them so long? It's been a week already."

    tsukune "They're waiting on the replacement AC compressor to get delivered. Gotta love having an older car and waiting longer for the parts for the come in."

    alex "You know, I don't have a problem with driving you home until the car's repaired."

    tsukune "Really? That's awesome, I appreciate it! It's honestly kind of embarassing to ask other people to help me out."

    alex "It's not a problem for me! Your place is on my way home, so it's not really inconveniencing me."

    tsukune "You're a great friend, Alex. I mean it."
    tsukune "Damn, I gotta get back to work. I'll talk to you later!"
