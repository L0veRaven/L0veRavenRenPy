    This game contains depictions of stalking, violence, death, sexual harassment and themes referencing sexual assault.{w=0.5}

    The creator of the game, L0veRaven, does not condone such actions being enacted in the real world.

    {clear}

    If you have not been made aware of these themes prior to the purchase of this game and no longer have an interest in playing the game, please contact the creator at {u}support@l0veraven.com{/u} with proof of purchase in order to receive a refund.{w=0.5}
