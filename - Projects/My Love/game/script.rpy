    alex "Well if you're moving in, don't worry about the noise. It's a one-time thing I'm sure. I guess you're my neighbor, right?"
    claudia "Yup! It took a couple hours to get everything out of the moving van, but I still have to unpack stuff. It'll be a while before everything is out of those boxes, but I'll try to keep the noise down!"
    claudia "Moving to a new place can be pretty challenging, but I needed the change of scenery."
    alex "It can be good to move to a new area. Fresh starts, you know?"
    claudia "I'm definitely with you there. My name's Claudia. What about you?"
    alex "Oh, I'm Alex. I don't have any nicknames, though. My name is kinda too short for that."
    alex "I'm kinda surprised it took them two and a half years to fill that unit."
    claudia "It's been that long? I better make sure to deep clean it then. I can't stand when dust builds up, and you know that maintenance doesn't do upkeep with empty units."
    alex "I get what you mean. It can be a struggle sometimes to pick up the slack for lazy apartment managers, right?"
    claudia "Heh... Yeah, it is."
    claudia "So... you've lived here for a while?"
    alex "Yeah, I've been here for about three years now."
    claudia "There aren't any roaches here, right?"
    alex "Oh, no! They have pest control come out here every week, so wer don't have any pests like that around here."
    claudia "That's great. The place before the one I just moved from had a pretty bad roach infestation. You can thank the hoarder neighbors for that."
    claudia "Anyways, I'd better start unpacking and cleaning. I'll see you later!"

    tsukune "Yesterday, my car's AC compressor seized up and snapped the serpentine belt, so now my car's in the shop until they get the parts delivered to replace what got trashed."
    alex "That sucks! How much did it cost to get here by bus?"
    tsukune "It was about $3.50 just to get here, but I could only use coins or cash. They don't do card on any of the buses in town apparently."
    tsukune "I'll live though! It could be a lot more expensive like in some other cities."
    tsukune "Anyways, I should probably get to my desk now. Don't wanna get in any trouble."
    alex "Wait, before you go, I can take you to and from work until your car is fixed. We live in the same apartment complex after all."
    tsukune "Really? Are you sure that's fine? I can pay you back in gas mon-"
    alex "Don't worry about it, it's on me. I wanna help you out if I can, and it's not like I'm going out of my way to take you home."
    alex "I'm still doing the same drive as usual, just with an extra person in the car with me."
    tsukune "You're a great friend, Alex. I'll meet you after work, alright?"

    alex "What do you mean?"
    tsukune "Well... Geez, it's kind of embarassing to admit it, but I've started seeing a therapist again."
    alex "... Again?"
    tsukune "Yeah, I was getting close to relapsing on smoking cigarettes for the first time in two years."
    alex "I never knew you smoked."
    tsukune "Yeah, I don't really advertise it. It's not something I'm proud of being addicted to."
    alex "You're still addicted?"
    tsukune "You never really stop being addicted to things, I've learned."
    tsukune "Usually, it's either a person distracts themself from their addictions or they get themselves addicted to something that's better for you."
    tsukune "For me, I distract myself with creative activities. If I keep my hands busy, I'm less likely to think about smoking."

    alex "So how has therapy been helping you out?"
    tsukune "Having a professional to talk to about my issues helps to keep me more level-headed. It can be pretty easy for me to get into self-loathing loops."
    tsukune "The self-loathing is usually a trigger for my cigarette cravings."
    alex "I'm glad therapy is working is working out for you! I know it can be hard for people to start therapy."
    tsukune "It really can be, especially if you have an insurance that isn't commonly covered locally."
    tsukune "I'm just thankful that I quit smoking before I started working here. it sucks to have people side-eyeing you and talking shit for having an addiction."
    alex "Were your old coworkers mad about it?"
    tsukune "Mad isn't the right word... It was them being judgemental more than anything else."
    tsukune "They thought I couldn't hear them, but they made sure to change the topic real quick when I made my presence known."
    alex "Aw man, that really sucks... You're not dealing with that here, right?"
    tsukune "Luckily, I'm not dealing with that here."
